# SchipholFlightAnalyser

The goal of this tool is to analyse the flights of Schiphol using their [Public Flight API](https://developer.schiphol.nl/).
You can register for free to obtain an API key and add this in the `config.yml` (see sample file).

## Flight distribution
One research question which could be answered using this tool is the following one: are the flights coming and going from Schiphol distributed evenly over the 24 hours of a natural day?
